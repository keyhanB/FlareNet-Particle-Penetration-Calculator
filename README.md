# FlareNet-Particle-Penetration-Calculator

This project is complementary of the [FlareNet Particle Penetration Calculator (FPPC)](https://github.com/keyhanB/FlareNet-Particle-Penetration-Calculator) for calculating the mass and number losses in the sampling tubes for different aerosol sampling instruments and generating graphs for comparing mass and number distribution.
