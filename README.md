# FlareNet Particle Penetration Calculator (FPPC)

This program can calculate aerosol loss (1- penetration) for the sampling line with using effective density. Several different loss mechanisms are potentially important depending on the particle size distribution and density. The target is to facilitate complicated calculations and help readers to expedite these cumbersome computations efficiently.
